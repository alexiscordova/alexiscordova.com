To illustrate how small the Bluetooth speaker was (while having great sound), we created a component that began zoomed into the speaker grill, then zoomed out to show the true size. To show how the small device could have such great bass, we had an image of the speaker with a video (using the HTML5 Video API) that showed the dual passive radiators vibrating."},{"name":"Sony Hotspots","type":"image","isVisible":true,"imageUrl":"sony/sony-hotspots-large.jpg","details":"Hotspots were a great tool to selectively display additional content. When a user clicked or tapped on the circular button, the user would be presented with a popup (or overlay on mobile) with the information related to that hotspot. This allowed us to show the information that was of interest to the user."},{"name":"Sony Walkman","type":"image","isVisible":true,"imageUrl":"sony/sony-walkman-large.jpg","details":"The NWZ-W273/NWZ-W274S—or the waterproof Walkman—was a great opportunity for a custom module. Using HTML5 Canvas, we created an animation where the Walkman looked to be dunked in water as the user scrolled down the page. The product would them float and bob in the water, and the water moved as if there was a light current passing through the screen."}]
