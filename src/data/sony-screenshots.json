To illustrate how small the Bluetooth speaker was, I created a component that began zoomed into the speaker grill, then zoomed out to show its true size. To show how the innovative speaker design fit in such a small enclosure, I placed an image of the speaker with a HTML5 video layered on top that showed the dual passive radiators vibrating when the module was scrolled into view."

When a user clicked or tapped on the circular button, the user would be presented with a popup (or overlay on mobile) with the information related to that hotspot. This allowed us to show the information that was of interest to the user."
