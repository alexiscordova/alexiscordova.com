{"name":"Portfolio Introduction","id":"portfolio-introduction","isVisible":true,"filename":"portfolio-introduction.json","headline":"alexiscordova.com","text":"The portfolio of Alexis Córdova (alexiscordova.com) is the site you’re on right now. Welcome! This is the fourth version of the site, and its primary purpose is to display some of the work I’ve done in my career, as well as serving as a sandbox to try different development tools and techniques.\n\nThis site has had a slew of different technological approaches in the past, mainly ones that expanded experience I gained or refined at previous jobs. Instead, this time I took on the challenge of using many technologies that I had never used before, primarily React.js, Node.js (for basic server creation), Webpack 2, and NPM scripts.\n\nDespite my initial misgivings about React (hearing “you write your CSS in JavaScript!” made me cringe), I learned the fundamentals and was able to create a functioning prototype in about a day (don't ask how long it took to get Hot Module Replacement working, though). I replaced Gulp.js with Webpack (initially version 1, but decided on version 2 for future proofing) and NPM scripts, which was refreshingly straightforward.\n\nMy biggest worry was writing Node.js. As a UI developer, back-end development isn't generally my definition of “fun.” But, in reality, Node.js is simply JavaScript. My biggest Node.js hurdle was creating a script that fetched data from [Contentful](https://contentful.com), the service I decided on to manage my content. Despite a few early stumbles, everything turned out pretty great.\n\nWhile I did rely heavily on my previous component library experience, I hadn't integrated that knowledge with React before; I was very happy to find out that the two work perfectly together. Honestly, despite many in the tech community seeing component library development as a \"design\" exercise, I truly believe this is the best way forward for web development, be it sites or apps.\n\n- **Client**: Alexis Córdova\n- **Technology**: React.js, Node.js, Sass (SCSS), HTML5, Webpack 2, NPM, Amazon Web Services, Contentful\n- **Responsibilities**: Development and everything else possible\n- **Code**: [GitHub](https://github.com/alexiscordova/alexiscordova.com)\n"}
