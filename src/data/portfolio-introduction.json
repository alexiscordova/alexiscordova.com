Welcome! This is the third version of the site, and its primary purpose is to display some of the work I’ve done in my career, as well as serving as a sandbox to try different development tools and techniques.\n\nThis site has had a few different technological approaches: the first approach was using Grunt–powered Jade templates and JSON for data; a similar approach used for the UI codebase on the [Sony Web Transformation Project](/work/sony). Each groupings of elements were created as modules, using Require.js for JavaScript and Sass (SCSS) for CSS. While I think this approach definitely has its advantages, it felt a bit unnecessarily complex for the task.\n\nThe second approach used Jekyll as the build engine, while still utilizing a modular approach with Require.js and Sass. Jekyll allowed me to simplify the data structure using JSON and YAML, and replacing Jade templates with Liquid templates (similar to Handlebars). I also took advantage of a few Grunt plugins, such as Autoprefixer and Modernizr custom builds, as well as SVGStore, which creates a SVG map (similar to a sprite sheet, but in code) from individual SVG files.\n\nThe third—and current—version of the site replaced Grunt with Gulp, Require.js with Browserify, and removed jQuery altogether for vanilla JavaScript. I extended Jekyll’s capabilities by writing a little bit of Ruby, and leveraged third-party frameworks to simplify the CSS architecture.\n\n- **Client**: Alexis Córdova\n- **Technology**: HTML5, Jekyll, YAML, Liquid, CSS3, Sass (SCSS), JavaScript, Browserify, Gulp, SVG\n- **Responsibilities**: Prototyping, Design, Development, Testing & QA\n"}
