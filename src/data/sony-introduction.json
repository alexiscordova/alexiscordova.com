{"name":"Sony Introduction","id":"sony-introduction","isVisible":true,"filename":"sony-introduction.json","headline":"Sony.com","text":"In its previous version, Sony.com was primarily a home page which lead directly to the online store. Subcategories of Electronics, PlayStation, and Entertainment all pointed to different sites with different interfaces, leading to a very disjointed user experience. The Web Transformation Project set out to remedy this by creating a marketing site for all things Sony, using consistent messaging and a new look and feel to reinforce “One Sony.”\n\nUsing technologies such as Jade (now named [Pug](https://pugjs.org)), Require.js, Sass, and Grunt, we were able to create a variety of library modules to construct marketing pages for Sony’s top-tier products. Custom modules were also created which helped craft unique stories for specific products. These modules utilized HTML5 Canvas, HTML5 Audio & Video, and other modern technologies to help describe the user benefits to potential customers.\n\nThis project used responsive design techniques, including a custom-written JavaScript library to handle responsive images. While desktop, mobile, and tablet dimensions were targeted, the net was cast even wider to handle televisions and consoles (PS3/PS4) and other handheld devices (PS Vita), as well as retina-enabled (HiDPI) devices.\n\nThe new Sony website launched on January 28, 2014 in 36 European countries, translated in 22 languages. Launches in Latin and South America (launched in conjunction with the 2014 World Cup in Brazil), Asia, and the United States are all now live.\n\n- **Client**: Sony Corporation of America\n- **Technology**: HTML5, Jade (with JSON), CSS 3, Sass (SCSS), jQuery, Require.js, Grunt\n- **Responsibilities**: Module Development, Prototyping, Testing & QA\n- **Website**: [Sony UK](http://sony.co.uk)"}
