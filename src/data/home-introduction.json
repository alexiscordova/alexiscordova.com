I’ve developed sites for a variety of companies and organizations—large and small—and now am focusing on building and architecting component libraries and front-end UI systems for web software.\n\nTim Berners-Lee proposed the idea of the World Wide Web on my 6th birthday, so I like to think it was meant to be."
