I’ve been playing with the web since 1996, and have worked professionally in the web industry for 10 years. I’ve developed sites for a variety of companies and organizations—large and small—and now am focusing on building and architecting component libraries, front-end UI systems, and writing modern, standards-based code.\n\nTim Berners-Lee proposed the idea of the World Wide Web on my 6th birthday, so I like to think it was meant to be."
