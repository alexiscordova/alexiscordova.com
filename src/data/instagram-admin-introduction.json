  "text": "The Instagram administrator interface is a side-project (not designed for broad release) to allow users web access to their Instagram data, primarily liked content. Ideally, one would then be able to download all their content and be able to see all their activity in a single place.\n\nOn the whole, the Instagram website is a second-class citizen in their ecosystem; Instagram began as a mobile platform, and understandably that is where their focus is. However, the data to bring the website up to speed is available through the Instagram API, so it seemed like a good opportunity. I previously used an [If This Then That](https://ifttt.com) recipe to automatically download my liked photos, which allowed me to set my computer screensaver to display those photos. It was pretty rad, and I was then able to enjoy this content for a longer period of time.\n\nUnfortunately, Instagram changed their API guidelines, limiting access to their API until the app was submitted for approval. Because this side-project was not for wide release (it was, in part, an attempt to learn React.js), I mimicked the current Instagram.com site design, which would never be approved. Going forward I plan to redesign this app for the specific purpose of viewing and downloading liked content.\n\n- **Client**: Alexis CÃ³rdova\n- **Technology**: React.js, ES6/ES2015, Webpack, Sass (SCSS)\n- **Responsibilities**: Development\n- **Code**: [GitHub](https://github.com/alexiscordova/instagram-admin)"
