{"name":"Is It Baseball Season Yet Introduction","id":"iibbsy-introduction","filename":"iibbsy-introduction.json","headline":"Is It Baseball Season Yet","text":"Is It Baseball Season Yet is a sports side project originally created as an attempt to pass the time during the Major League Baseball offseason.\n\nVersion 1 was a simple scoreboard app that, during the season, pulled in scores from live MLB games and displayed them on a crudely–made AT&T Park/Fenway Park–esque scoreboard. The data is powered by the official MLB Advanced Media (MLBAM) JSON feed; the same data used to power MLB At Bat and MLB Gameday.\n\nDuring the offseason, a counter is displayed counting down the days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the first official MLB game of the upcoming season. Version 2 will focus more on a specific set of players and their stats, allowing users to check in on their favorite stars throughout the season (time permitting. This is a side project, after all).\n\n- **Client**: Alexis Córdova\n- **Technology**: HTML5, CSS3, Sass (SCSS), jQuery; MLBAM API\n- **Responsibilities**: Design, Development\n- **Website**: [Is It Baseball Season Yet](http://isitbaseballseasonyet.com)"}
