{"name":"Is It Baseball Season Yet Introduction","id":"iibbsy-introduction","isVisible":true,"filename":"iibbsy-introduction.json","headline":"Is It Baseball Season Yet","text":"Is It Baseball Season Yet is a sports side project originally created as an attempt to pass the time during the Major League Baseball offseason.\n\nDuring the offseason (and pre-season), a counter is displayed counting down the days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the first game of the upcoming MLB season. This is particularly popular on Twitter with people like myself who need to know *exactly* how much time remains until the season starts.\n\nDuring the season, the countdown is replaced with a scoreboard of the day's games. The data is retrieved from the official MLB Advanced Media (MLBAM) JSON feed—the same data used to power MLB At Bat and MLB Gameday—and is consumed by an Ember.js app.\n\n*[Developer's Note: Ironically, this app is not currently live despite it truly being baseball season. I am considering updating this to a React.js app, but only as time permits (which it hasn't as of yet).]*\n\nIdeally, I'd love to do more with the data provided by the MLB API; however, the API is kind of a mess and has no documentation. As they say in baseball, “you see something new every day,” which is fun when you're trying to debug an app. When time permits, this side project will get a lot more love.\n\n- **Client**: Alexis Córdova\n- **Technology**: HTML5, Sass (SCSS), Ember.js; MLBAM API\n- **Responsibilities**: Design, Development\n- **Website**: [Is It Baseball Season Yet](http://isitbaseballseasonyet.com)\n- **Code**: [Countdown Timer](https://github.com/alexiscordova/iibbsy-countdown), [Ember.js App](https://github.com/alexiscordova/iibbsy)"}
